Configure AWS Fluent bit for collecting log.
I have already set up an ECR repository for the nginx and php fpm images. Built the application with lumen and pushed to the repository.
Once the images are ready can create task definitions to be used for the services. Now we need to create a cluster and launch services inside this cluster.
The task definitions we have created will be used to run tasks for the services. How a service will run entirely depend on the task definition.
